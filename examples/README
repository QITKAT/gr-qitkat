Example 1
In this example, we demonstrate the super-dense coding (SDC) encoding blocks. Alice reads in
a file, encodes it with our SDC flags, then writes these flags to file.
Bob reads in this file, decodes it back to the original file Alice read
in.

Example 2
In this example, we demonstrate how a binary symmetric channel affects
the bit error rate (BER) of the transmitted data. By adjusting the error
rate between 0 and 1.0 we simulate various levels of channel noise
between Alice and Bob.
